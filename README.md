# CINDEX for Windows
CINDEX is a software tool for professional indexers, enabling them to produce indexes in a variety of formats.

CINDEX for Windows works on any supported version of Microsoft Windows, including Windows 10 and 11.

## Version 4.3 Changes
1.	Removes Demo and Student versions of Cindex. Only the full versions of Cindex (Standard and Publishers’ Edition) are now available.
2.	Removes registration requirement.
3.	Improves performance in checking cross-references via the **Check Index…** command.
4.	Cindex can now directly create a new index from a Macrex .mbk file or a Sky Index file of type .sky7, .txtsky7, or txtsky8. If you choose one of these file types via the **Open** command (File menu), Cindex will create a new index of the same name then import the records. You can also create a new index by double-clicking the document icon.
